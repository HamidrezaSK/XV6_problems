A priority based scheduler selects the process with highest priority for execution.
In case two or more processes have same priority, we choose them in a round robin fashion.
The of a process can be in the , smaller value will represent higher priority.
Set the priority of a process as To change the default priority add a new system call "set_priority"
which can change the priority of a process.
The system-call returns the old-priority value of the process. In case the the priority of the
process increases (the value is lower than before), then rescheduling should be done.
