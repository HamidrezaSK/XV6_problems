Implement a Multi-Level Queue Scheduling which will have 3 queues:
• First Queue : The first queue will hold the high priority processes. The processes in this queue will be scheduled according to the guaranteed scheduling policy (Implement any fair scheduling policy of your choice).
• Second Queue : The second queue will hold medium priority processes. The processes in this queue will be scheduled according to the FIFO round robin scheduling policy.
• Third Queue : The third queue will hold low priority processes. The processes in this queue will be scheduled according to the round robin scheduling policy.
A process with a higher priority will be preferred and run before a process with a lower priority. 
Add a sys-call nice() which can decrease the priority of a process ( returns 0 on success , else -1 )
and can be used to demonstrate the results.

Output: Output the results in the form of a report for a small example which demonstrates the correct working of the scheduler.
Take the advantage of the output of waitx system-call, and report the average turn-around time for each of the process.
